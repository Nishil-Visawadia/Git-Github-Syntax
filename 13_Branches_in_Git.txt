Branches (Best feature of git)
Branch creates a differnt copy of the master branch, so while the master branch is in production it won't cause any harm to the existing code.
Master in the default branch

git branch feature      // creates a branch naming feature
git branch              // shows the branches (green denotes the branch in which you are particularly)
git checkout master     // switched to master branch
git checkout feature    // switched to the feature branch
git status              // displays the status of the branch

If feature branch of the project is better and you want to merge with master branch
git branch              // shows the branches (green denotes the branch in which you are particularly)
git checkout master     // use this to switch to master branch
git log -p -2           // to check the commit logs
git merge feature       // feature branch is merged with master branch

git checkout -b newbranch   // to create and switch to the "newbranch" in single line command
git branch                  // will display you are in the "newbranch"
