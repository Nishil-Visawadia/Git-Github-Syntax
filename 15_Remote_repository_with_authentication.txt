Remote Repository
A repository is made on Github and you want to connect on your system
git remote add origin "URL of the repository"       // add a remote with name origin
git remote                                          // displays the list of remote
git remote -v                                       // displays url of fetch and push
git push origin master                              // push the master branch to the origin (remote repo / url)
(if the repository is private it will display an error)

Provide your GitHub username and password
        Create Token Access
            Go to github Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access Tokens> Tokens > Generate new token(Classic)
            Add Note(Name of access token)
            Select scopes (tick repo)
            Generate token
        
        Add username and Acess token

(if you want to add feature branch to the github)
git checkout feature
git push origin feature                             // push the feature branch to the origin (remote repo / url)

git checkout master
git push -u origin master
(after doing this, just the git push command is enough to push the repository instead of doing git push origin master all the time)
git push    // will automatically push to the master branch
