To commit the file (commit statement should be such that it should be informative and value addition to what you commited in the existing/new code)
git commit
after this an editor will open, write "Initial commit" on the 1st line and press ESC :wq to escape vim
Note: Initial commit is a comment

git status      // To check the files in working directory are placed in the git
(git will display "nothing to commit, working tree clean" if all the files are commited)
(even after a commit if a file is edited it will display in git status as "modified" and can be added using git add -A and then commited)

git commit -m "Added modified files"        // use this command as it doesn't open any editor and the files are directly commited

git commit -a -m "Skipped staging area and fixed"       // to add and commit the files at same time
